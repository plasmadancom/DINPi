</p>

Created for use with some of our home automation HATs, DINPi allows plug & play connection for Raspberry Pi add-on boards in a DIN rail mountable package. Multiple boards can be daisy chained to create an array of connected HATs or pHATs. Available as a kit, simply solder whichever headers / sockets you require for your project. Or buy an assembled unit with all the parts pre-installed [here](https://plasmadan.com/dinpi).

**New:** DINPi now has a big brother! Check-out our [HAT RACK](https://github.com/plasmadancom/HAT-RACK) board. It's backwards compatible!

## Features
* Plug & Play Raspberry Pi or Pi Zero
* Daisy chain multiple boards
* DIN rail mountable

## Versatile

The "ribbon cable" style board design allows DINPi boards to be used in a number of ways. The additional mirrored pinout allows multiple boards to be connected together using right-angle headers & sockets and can also be used to mount a Raspberry Pi upside-down while maintaining correct GPIO pinout.

You can build the DINPi yourself! Download the <a href="https://plasmadan.shop/product/dinpi-gerber-file-download/" target="_blank">Gerber files</a> from our website (you can name your own price). Once you have downloaded the Gerber pack, simply submit the pre-prepared zip file to your preferred PCB manufacturer, we highly recommend [PCBWay](https://www.pcbway.com/setinvite.aspx?inviteid=19024). You can change the colour, surface finish, gold plating and more.
